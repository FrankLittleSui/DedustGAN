# code for DedustGAN
Thanks to Shiyu Zhao: [RefineDNet-for-dehazing](https://github.com/xiaofeng94/RefineDNet-for-dehazing),the code refers to their work.

# Datasets
The indoor synthetic dusty dataset we used is derived from Jiayan Huang's SIDNet: A single image dedusting network with color cast correction, you can download it by the [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1S-bZ-gTcDSa72OpNVsl-qg)(c0kq).

# Checkpoints
We provide pre-trained weights on synthetic dusty dataset SID and unpaired real dusty dataset.[link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/16UN2sutzwHm-MXLzo03wMA)(395n).We also provide some samples testd with real pre-trained weight.[link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Jyy7h5pFq5N2pq3Ipv2LVg)(mr9f)
