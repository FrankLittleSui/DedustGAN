# code for DedustGAN: Unpaired Learning for Image Dedusting Based on Retinex with GANs
Thanks to Shiyu Zhao: [RefineDNet-for-dehazing](https://github.com/xiaofeng94/RefineDNet-for-dehazing),the code refers to their work.

# Datasets
The indoor synthetic dusty dataset we used is derived from Jiayan Huang's SIDNet: A single image dedusting network with color cast correction, you can download it by the [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1S-bZ-gTcDSa72OpNVsl-qg)(c0kq)
# Checkpoints
We provide training weights on synthetic dusty dataset SID and unpaired real dusty dataset.[link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1lnlGMYjhpKKnJzEAbsm9KQ)(bzsv)
